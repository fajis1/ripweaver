> [!TIP]
> For the complete changelog history, see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Jsakkos/mkv-episode-matcher/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) in the repository.

## Unreleased - 2026-08-10

- Added opt-in, path-free matched-disc contributions with a private retryable
  outbox and durable match-provenance tracking.
- Added piecewise community consensus: two independent matching uploads with a
  strict lead confirm each title, while conflicts hold only affected titles.
- Added non-authorizing single-upload candidate help after local matching is
  unable to resolve a title; server-assisted results cannot vote or earn credit.
- Added partial catalogue lookup handling so confirmed titles can continue while
  disputed bonus items remain in local review.
- Added stable hashed Windows optical-device mapping so temporary MakeMKV slot
  renumbering cannot redirect work to another physical drive.
- Added a first-run/change-detection wizard with one-click approval for all
  currently detected intentional drives and exact-snapshot batch saving.
- Added fail-closed USB identity-change handling, safe similar-device warnings,
  and retirement of absent old trusted identities.
- Added a MakeMKV-confirmation guard: a Windows-only provisional slot cannot
  prepare or rip a disc.
- Added separately confirmed continuation for loaded discs after drive setup
  when automatic processing is enabled.
- Documented exact-device Windows restart, USB/SATA power-cycle recovery, and
  the remaining loaded-but-Windows-unreadable state distinction in
  [Windows optical-drive mapping and recovery](WINDOWS_OPTICAL_DRIVE_RECOVERY.md).
